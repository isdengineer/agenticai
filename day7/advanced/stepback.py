Docstring for agentloop.advanced.stepback

This advanced technique prevents the LLM from getting bogged down in specifics. It forces the LLM to generate a generalized, "step-back" question first, uses that to retrieve general context, and then answers the original, specific question. This is combined with LangChain Routers.
